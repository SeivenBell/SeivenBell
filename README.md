### ðŸš€ ML Projects

#### Wildfire Growth Prediction | Hackathon Winner
Built a CNN-based model that predicts wildfire spread patterns with 87% accuracy using satellite imagery, weather data, and topographical information. This tool helps emergency response teams better allocate resources and plan evacuation routes.

#### Semi-Supervised Image Classification
Developed a neural network architecture that reduced labeled data requirements by 80% while maintaining classification accuracy. This approach makes scientific research more efficient by minimizing the expensive manual labeling process typically required.

#### ML-Enhanced Quantum Compiler
Integrated PyTorch ML models into an LLVM compiler front-end, reducing errors by 30% and improving runtime efficiency by 15%. This work bridges the gap between classical machine learning and quantum computing applications.

#### Fluorescence Image Classification Pipeline
Created a distributed ML pipeline that improved classification accuracy by 31% for 500,000 fluorescence images across 16 classes. Applied model quantization techniques that enabled real-time deployment on FPGA with 29% reduced memory footprint.

### ðŸ”¬ ML Experience

My ML engineering journey spans roles at Open Quantum Design and Waterloo.AI, where I've applied semi-supervised learning techniques, developed anomaly detection systems, and optimized ML models for deployment on specialized hardware. I'm particularly interested in quantum machine learning applications and developing ML systems that can scale efficiently.
